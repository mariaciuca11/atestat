A producer can add characters to the buffer only by means of the procedure
append inside the monitor; the producer does not have direct access to buffer. The
procedure first checks the condition notfull to determine if there is space available
in the buffer. If not, the process executing the monitor is blocked on that condition.
Some other process (producer or consumer) may now enter the monitor. Later,
when the buffer is no longer full, the blocked process may be removed from the
queue, reactivated, and resume processing. After placing a character in the buffer,
the process signals the notempty condition. A similar description can be made of the
consumer function.
This example points out the division of responsibility with monitors compared
to semaphores. In the case of monitors, the monitor construct itself enforces mutual
exclusion: It is not possible for both a producer and a consumer simultaneously to
access the buffer. However, the programmer must place the appropriate cwait and
csignal primitives inside the monitor to prevent processes from depositing
items in a full buffer or removing them from an empty one. In the case of sema-
phores, both mutual exclusion and synchronization are the responsibility of the
programmer.
